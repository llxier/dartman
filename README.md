# dartman
> A simple file watcher for your next dart app

This project is heavily inspired by [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (as you can tell from the name)

## Installation
`pub global activate dartman`

## Usage
`dartman [your dart app]`

dartman will watch for changes in your projects root directory and restart your app everytime you edit something.
